This is the code for Distractor Generation, based on single fine tuned system training of QA_CL model. The model reads distractor input question, answer and support with output with distractors.

DA_CL.py in this folder is the code which resulted in the trained model utilized to generate the results from the paper. It was run on the HPC Hábròk from the RUG, using a NVIDIA A100 GPU.

The model pipeline is read on Jupyter.
